  "2A": "What is Driving?"
  "2B": "The Driver is responsible for the safe transport of passengers across the entire network of SCR. Once a driver arrives at their scheduled stop, they open their doors for boarding, load the passengers, close the doors and then depart the station to continue to their next stop. These steps may vary slightly depending on the roles involved, i.e. Guard and/or Dispatcher."
  "2C": "Everyone, regardless of their rank, is able to play in the Driver role in-game. To obtain the Qualified Driver rank, a Trainee Driver (obtained by joining the SCR group) must attend and pass the Qualified Driver training after earning 60 experience. The training consists of a briefing, Q&A and assessment."
